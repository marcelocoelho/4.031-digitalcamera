# 4.031 Digital Camera - Code Samples - 2024 Edition

These are a few different code samples that you can use to build your camera. Look at the readme.md file in each folder for more information on how to use them.

**A_CameraController**  
Arduino code that takes input from a button and encoder and sends to the computer by using the Arduino as a keyboard. 

**Helper Sketches**
Arduino examples for using different kinds of sensors and actuators.

**Py_Camera**
Python code that uses OpenCV to capture images from a webcam and saves them to the local machine.

**P5_Camera**
P5.js code that displays a live view from a webcam and allows the user to take photos. It uses vite for code autorefresh and running a local server. This version is more complex from the one below, but it is easier to expand upon.

**P5_Camera_Simple**
P5.js code that displays a live view from a webcam and allows the user to take photos and saves them to the local machine. It has two ways to save a photo: using a keyboard input or pressing a button on the screen.
