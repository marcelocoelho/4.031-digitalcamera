# P5.js Camera using node and vite

This is a simple template for a camera app that combines P5.js sketch and Vite for code autorefresh.

### What it does:

- Press 'c' to take a photo and save it to the local machine

## Requirements

This template requires a recent version of Node.js, recommended version 16 or later. Follow installation instructions here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Clone the repository with git or download the code from the repository as a zip file.

Then install the libraries:

    cd P5_Camera
    npm install

## Start the dev environment

This template uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a local development server. Start it with the following:

    npm run dev

By default, this starts a local server at http://localhost:5173/. Just copy/paste this URL into
a browser window to view the app. This will automatically update when you save changes to your code (that is, no manual refresh required!).
